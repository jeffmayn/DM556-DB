9.7: Explain what the buffer manager must do to process a read request for
a page. What happens if the requested page is in the pool but not pinned?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a page is requested the buffer manager does the following:
1.
The buffer pool is checked to see if it contains the requested page. If the page is in
the pool, skip to step 2. If the page is not in the pool, it is brought in as follows:
(a) A frame is chosen for replacement, using the replacement policy.
(b) If the frame chosen for replacement is dirty, it is flushed (the page it contains
is written out to disk).
(c) The requested page is read into the frame chosen for replacement.
2.
The requested page is pinned (the pin count of the chosen frame is incremented)
and its address is returned to the requester.


9.8: When does a buffer manager write a page to disk?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
n/a

9.9: What does it mean to say that a page is pinned in the buffer pool? Who
is responsible for pinning pages? Who is responsible for unpinning pages?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Pinning a page means the pin count of its frame is incremented.
Pinning a page guarantees higher-level DBMS software that the page will not be
removed from the buffer pool by the buffer manager. That is, another file page
will not be read into the frame containing this page until it is unpinned by this requestor.
2.
It is the buffer managerâ€™s responsibility to pin a page.
3.
It is the responsibility of the requestor of that page to tell the buffer manager to unpin a page.

9.10: When a page in the buffer pool is modified, how does the DBMS ensure
that this change is propagated to the disk? (Explain the role of the buffer manager as
well as the modifier of the page.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
n/a

9.11: What happens if a page is requested when all pages in the buffer pool
are dirty?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are some unpinned pages, the buffer manager chooses one by
using a replacement policy, flushes this page, and then replaces it with the requested
page
