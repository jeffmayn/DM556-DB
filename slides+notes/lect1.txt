  - Data on external storage

Buffer manager:
  - buffer pool

  CLUSTERED V SUNCLUSTERED
  ------------------------------
  When a file is organized so ordering of data records is the same (or close to)
  the ordering of data entries in some index we say this index is clustered -
  otherwise the index is unclustered.

  COST MODEL
  ------------------------------------------------------
  B: Number of pages when records are packed with no wasted space
  R: Number of records per page
  D: Average time to read/write a page
  C: Average time to process a record
  H: Time to apply hash function
  F: Fann-out of tree (>100)

  BUFFER MANAGER
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  Assume db contains 1.000.000 pages, and only 1.000 pages of main
  memory. Consider query that require a scan of entire.
  DBMS must bring pages into main memory as they are needed, and in the
  process decide what in main memory to replace.

  Buffer manager is software layer responsible for bringing pages from
  disk to main memory as needed.

  Manages available free memory by partitioning it into a collection of pages:
  the buffer pool. The main memory pages in the buffer pool is called frames
    - Frame is a slot in main memory that can hold a page

  BUFFER REPLACEMENT POLICIES
  --------------------------------------
  LRU: Least Recently Used
  CLOCK: Approximating LRU (also called second chance)
  FIFO: First In First Out
  MRU: Most Recently Used
  Random
