Query optimization
----------------------------------

Roadmap:
translation to relational alg. -> query plan cost est. -> query plan enum.

SQL provides an extension to relational algebra: for instance 'group by' and 'having'

Goal of optimization:: To find more efficient plans that compute the same answer
