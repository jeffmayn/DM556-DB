## Exam Keywords - Relational operator evaluation


 1.  System catalog (breifly)
     * Minimum information (system-wide, table, etc.)
     * Other (Cardinality, Size, etc.)
     * Catalog storage in DBMS
 2.  Access paths (~)
     * Index
     * Iteration
     * Partitioning
 3.  Access Path Selectivity
 4.  Select (important to explain IO cost)
     * Index / No index
     * Sorted / unsorted
     * Cost(s) (Only most efficient implementations)
 5.  Join (important to explain IO cost)
     * Nested loops (and improvements)
     * Partitioning (Sort-merge, Hash)
     * Cost(s) (Only most efficient implementations)
 6.  Project (important to explain IO cost)
     * Same as with select and join
 7.  Set operators
     * Cross product / Intersection as join
     * Union -- duplicate removal
